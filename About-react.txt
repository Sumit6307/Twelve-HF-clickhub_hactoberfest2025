# ABOUT REACT

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook (Meta) and a community of developers. It focuses on composing UI from small, reusable components and uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering. React can be used to build single-page applications (SPAs), mobile apps (with React Native), and complex interactive UIs.

## WHY USE REACT?

* **Component-based**: build encapsulated components that manage their own state and compose them to create complex UIs.
* **Declarative**: describe how UI should look for each state and React updates the DOM efficiently.
* **Ecosystem**: strong tooling and libraries (React Router, Redux, Zustand, Next.js, Vite, etc.).
* **Performance**: virtual DOM diffing minimizes real DOM operations.
* **Community & Jobs**: large community, many tutorials, libraries, and job opportunities.

## KEY CONCEPTS

* **Components**: Functions or classes returning JSX (HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript).
* **JSX**: JavaScript XML — an expressive syntax to describe UI.
* **Props**: Read-only inputs to components.
* **State**: Local data a component manages and reacts to.
* **Lifecycle & Hooks**: useEffect, useState, useRef and other hooks for logic and side effects.
* **Virtual DOM**: React's lightweight copy of the DOM for efficient updates.

## FEATURES

* Functional components + Hooks
* One-way data flow (unidirectional)
* Reconciliation with virtual DOM
* Server-side rendering (Next.js)
* Rich developer tooling (React DevTools, fast refresh)

## GETTING STARTED (quick)

With Create React App:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

With Vite (fast + modern):

```
npm create vite@latest my-vite-app -- --template react
cd my-vite-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## BASIC EXAMPLE

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
